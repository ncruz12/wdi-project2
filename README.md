# Museum Events

## Description

This web based CRUD application shows events that take place in Museums. It lists the events
and when clicked on shows the name of the museum and a brief description. User can view events and add an event.

* User is in home page and can click on VIEW MUSEMS button or Events tag on the navigation bar and will be redirected to Events page.
* User will be able to see a list of all the events.
* User clicks on any event of their interest which will redirect them to view more information.
* The details about the event that are displayed are the name of the museum and a description of the event.
* The user is also able to ADD an event or DELETE one. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML /EJS
* Node/ Express
* MVC Pattern
* SQL
* CSS 

## Improvements/ Adjustments

I'll need to get the individual event to display more information when clicked on. I plan on adding an API that allows the user to view events that are coming up in that specific museum. The name of the event, date, and description will display. I also plan on adding a picture of the museum next to the name of the event.
