# Museum Events

## Description

This web based CRUD application lets users keep up with events that will take place in Museums. It allows them to view all their events, a single event, it also allows them to add and delete the events they have. When user clicks on a specific event the name of the museum and brief description is displayed. 


## Wireframes and User Stories

* User is in home page and can click on VIEW MUSEMS button or Events tag on the navigation bar and will be redirected to Events page.
* User will be able to see a list of all the events.
* User clicks on any event of their interest which will redirect them to view more information.
* The details about the event that are displayed are the name of the museum and a description of the event.
* The user is also able to ADD an event or DELETE one. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML /EJS
* Node/ Express
* MVC Pattern
* SQL
* CSS 

## Improvements/ Adjustments

I plan on adding an API that allows the user to view events that are coming up in that specific museum. The name of the event, date, and description will display. I also plan on adding a picture of the museum next to the name of the event. I also need to get the update functionality to work on the page.
